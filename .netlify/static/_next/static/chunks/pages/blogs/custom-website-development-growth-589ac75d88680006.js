Think of it like building a long-term asset, not a quick fix."},{id:2,question:"How long does it take to build a custom website?",answer:"Depending on the complexity, most custom websites take between 4 to 12 weeks, including design, development, and testing. The timeline can be shorter for smaller builds and longer for integrations-heavy platforms."},{id:3,question:"Do I need technical knowledge to manage a custom website?",answer:"No. A good developer will integrate a CMS (like WordPress, Strapi, or custom admin panel) so that you can manage content easily without coding"},{id:4,question:"What’s the difference between a custom website and one built on WordPress?",answer:"While WordPress can be used for custom sites too, many WordPress themes are prebuilt. A true custom website is built from scratch or with a lightweight framework, giving you full design and code control."},{id:5,question:"Is custom development better for e-commerce websites?",answer:"If you're planning a unique shopping experience or expecting growth, yes.
